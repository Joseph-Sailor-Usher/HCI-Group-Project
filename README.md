# HCI-Group-Project focused on Blindness
This project aims to create a computer application that addresses the accessibility needs of individuals with a specific disability. The application can be of any type, such as software, a game, a Chrome add-on, a website, or any other form that provides accessibility features for the chosen disability.

## Introduction to the Disability
In this section, we introduce and explain the chosen disability. We provide insights into the daily experiences of individuals living with this disability, highlighting the challenges they face when using computers.

[You can include information about the disability and its impact here]

## User Experience and Accessibility
We discuss the importance of accessibility, both in general and specifically pertaining to the chosen disability. We provide insights into the challenges users with this disability face when applications are not accessible.

[You can describe the importance of accessibility and the challenges faced by users here]

## Walk-Through of the Application
In this section, we provide a detailed walk-through of the application we have created for addressing the accessibility needs of individuals with the chosen disability. We explain the accessibility accommodations we have implemented and why these accommodations make a difference.

[You can describe the application, its features, and the accessibility accommodations you've made here]

## References
We maintain a list of resources used to complete our project, including sources for building the application and information about the chosen disability. Our references follow IEEE standards.

## Video Presentation
For the final submission, we have created a video walkthrough of our application. This video includes:

- Introduction and explanation of the chosen disability
- Insights into the daily experiences and challenges faced by individuals with the disability
- Discussion of the importance of accessibility
- Walk-through of our application with commentary on accessibility accommodations

Video Presentation Document
For this project, you are creating a computer application for your chosen disability. This can either be an application for users with the disability, or an application with accessibility features for the disability. It can be made using any kind of software and can be any kind of an application. In the past, I have received video games, chrome add-ons, websites, etc. Anything goes!
Your final submission for this project will be your video walkthrough of the application. You will not be submitting the application itself-- just the video. See the details below:
In your video, you must include information about your selected disability and what challenges they face when using computers. You also need to include a walk through of the application you created, and what kind of accommodations you had to make in order to make it accessible. Please see the rubric attached to this assignment for specifications.
For your submission, please submit a URL to your video-- you could use something like Microsoft Stream, Google Drive, OneDrive, YouTube, etc. Only one member of your group needs to submit.
Your video does not have a time requirement-- just make sure to fulfill the information on the rubric. Not all members of your team have to speak in the video.
This assignment falls into the final presentation category of this class, and is worth 30% of your final grade.
